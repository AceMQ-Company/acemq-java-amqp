## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Maven multi-module skeleton with the six modules of the target architecture.

  the Palantir Java format and a license header, JaCoCo with a coverage gate,
  and reproducible flattened POMs.
- Java 11 bytecode target on a JDK 17 or newer toolchain, so Spring Boot 2.7
  applications on Java 11 can consume the library.

  `AceFatalException`.
- Continuous integration: build and test matrix, formatting check, and the
